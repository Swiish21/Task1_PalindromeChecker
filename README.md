# Task1_PalindromeChecker

A palindrome is a word that can be read the same from first character to last and reversed

This repository contains a dart program palindrome checker, the program takes a given string, makes it all lowercase, ignores all or any special character.

It then takes the string and reverses the order of the characters then compares it to the normalized version.
If they match, it returns true, meaning the given string is a palindrome.
